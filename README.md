# CS2 Server on ARM64 using FEX
Major thanks to [sa-shiro/Satisfactory-Dedicated-Server-ARM64-Docker](https://github.com/ayayrom/Satisfactory-Dedicated-Server-ARM64-Docker), they figured the hardest part out.

---

## Getting Started

1. **Download or Clone Repository**:  
   You can download this repository by either the code button above or using  
   `git clone https://github.com/ayayrom/CS2-ARM64-Server-FEX.git`
   Next, you'll want to cd into it using this: `cd CS2-ARM64-Server-FEX`

2. **Setting up file system**:  
   **WIP, will do something about the security later**  
   - First, make the directories `cs2-data` and `fex-data`. You can accomplish this by doing `mkdir -p cs2-data fex-data`.
   - Second, give the directories permission by 
     - Using `chmod`:
       ```
       sudo chmod 777 cs2-data
       sudo chmod 777 fex-data
       sudo chmod 777 init-server.sh
       sudo chmod +x init-server.sh
       ```
     - Using `chown` (replace **USER_ID:GROUP_ID** with the desired user's IDs, for example, `1000:1000`):
       ```
       sudo chown -R USER_ID:GROUP_ID cs2-data
       sudo chown -R USER_ID:GROUP_ID fex-data
       ```
       (On Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), by default, the user with the ID `1000:1000` is `opc`. However, since this user is primarily intended for the setup process, it is advisable to utilize the `ubuntu` user with IDs `1001:1001`)

3. **Build the Docker Image**:  
   This section will take about ~15 minutes to compile from source. If it goes beyond that, check to make sure the compilation isn't stuck.  
   Run the command **IF YOU ARE USING ORACLE CLOUD'S AMPERE**:
   ```
   sudo docker build -t cs2-arm64 -f Dockerfile .
   ```
   Run the command **IF YOU ARE USING SOMETHING ELSE**:
   ```
   sudo docker build -t cs2-arm64 -f Dockerfile.generic .
   ```

4. **Run the Docker Image**:  
   To run the docker image, run the command:
   ```
   sudo docker compose up -d
   ```
   If you want to follow the logs after it is running, run the command:
   ```
   sudo docker compose logs -f
   ```

5. **Port Access and Forwarding**:  
   This setup uses `network_mode: host`, so Docker does not publish ports through `docker-proxy`.  
   Open the required CS2 ports directly on your router / cloud security list:
   - `27015/tcp`
   - `27015/udp`
   - `27020/udp`
   - `26900/udp`
   - `27005/udp`

   You will also need to allow the same ports on the host firewall. For UFW:
   ```
   sudo ufw allow 27015/tcp
   sudo ufw allow 27015/udp
   sudo ufw allow 27020/udp
   sudo ufw allow 26900/udp
   sudo ufw allow 27005/udp
   sudo ufw reload
   ```

Once you finish step 5, congrats! The server is now ready to be used. 

# Modifying Docker Compose Config
- If you want to change the game port, add `-port <port>` to `EXTRA_PARAMS`.
- Update your router / cloud security list / host firewall rules to the matching CS2 port set.
- In addition to the game port itself, verify related SourceTV/client/Steam-LAN ports against current CS2/Valve server documentation before exposing ports.
- Defaults in this repo: `27020/udp` (SourceTV), `27005/udp` (client), `26900/udp` (Steam-LAN).
- All EXTRA_PARAMS can be found by googling what you need. I cannot help you and will not help you on finding all the extra parameters that can be added. The current EXTRA_PARAMS is good enough for the server to run.
- Currently, installing MetaMod and CounterStrikeSharp is available. This will change in the future when I can dedicate some time to polishing this project.
- If you are installing plugins onto the server, you MUST disable ALWAYS_UPDATE_ON_START and enable INSTALL_MODDING. You must also change DOTNET_EnableWriteXorExecute to 0.
- You can find your STEAM_GAMESERVER_API by visiting [Valve's GameServer page](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/managegameservers). Once you go in there, you can create a new game server account by putting 730 in the App ID textbox, and whatever you want for the memo. I recommend putting `cs2-arm server` in the memo.
- I am still learning about docker compose, so this may be very insecure and I am sorry about that. 

# Common Questions
- **Q**: Can the server handle 10 players?
  - **A**: In my experience, I have not hosted a 10man yet. I have tested it with bot 10v10s, and it was spitting out `Slow Server Frame` almost every second. I have used it for a 1v1 on a custom workshop map. It was fine with almost no noticeable lag.
- **Q**: How do I install and play custom workshop maps?
  - **A**: In your linux terminal (not Counter-Strike!), run 
    ```
    sudo docker attach cs2-server
    ```
    If the server hasn't finished initializing, wait for it to finish until the server is running properly. When it is finished, input this command:
    ```
    host_workshop_map <workshop ID>
    ``` 
    If you don't know how to find workshop ID's, Google is your best friend.
    To exit out of the attached terminal, do CTRL+P and CTRL+Q in that order.
- **Q**: Can I optimize the server?
  - **A**: Yes, however, I have no idea if these options are secure for your system. I am currently using them, but I do not recommend these options if you value security. Input this json in fex-data/Config.json:
    ```
    {
    "Config": {
      "SilentLog": "0",
      "EnableCodeCacheValidation": "0",
      "X87ReducedPrecision": "1",
      "StrictInProcessSplitLocks": "0",
      "DisableTelemetry": "1",
      "EnableCodeCachingWIP": "0",
      "DynamicL1Cache": "0",
      "HalfBarrierTSOEnabled": "0",
      "KernelUnalignedAtomicBackpatching": "1",
      "DisableL2Cache": "0",
      "MaxInst": "5000",
      "MemcpySetTSOEnabled": "0",
      "RootFS": "Ubuntu_22_04",
      "Multiblock": "1",
      "VectorTSOEnabled": "0",
      "TSOEnabled": "0",
      "SMCChecks": "1"
      },
    "ThunksDB": {}
    }
    ```
- **Q**: My question isn't here!
  - **A**: If your question isn't here, visit the issues page and make an issue about it. I will add your question here if it already isn't here.

# Extra Ramblings
To be honest, a lot of GPT was used to make this project. Most of the time, when I didn't know something, I had it research things for me. This included the majority of the Dockerfile, the optimization of the FEX-Emulator, the parts including FEXRootFSFetcher, and docker compose patch for CounterStrikeSharp. I did not have the knowledge or the time for learning the FEX-Emulator properly.

However, it works. And that I am glad about. And I hope that this works for you, otherwise this was all for naught.

I have also tried to compress [zThundy/CS2-Server-on-ARM](https://github.com/zThundy/CS2-Server-on-ARM)'s Box64 implementation into a docker compose file, but it was riddled with segmentation faults left and right. When Box64 comes to be more stable, I will attempt it again, but for now, FEX will do.
